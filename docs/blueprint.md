## Core Features:

- Multimodal Layout Extraction: Extract text and its spatial coordinates from documents using Document AI, enabling Gemini to understand layout-based relationships.
- Zero-Shot Generative Extraction: Define extraction fields in natural language, allowing Gemini to automatically locate and extract information from various document formats without needing OCR templates.
- Automated Reasoning & Reconciliation: After extracting numeric data from documents, automatically performs mathematical calculations and logical checks to validate correctness.
- Complex Table Reconstruction: Reconstruct multi-page, nested, or borderless tables into structured JSON or CSV formats using Gemini's long context capabilities.
- Semantic Summary & Compliance Scanning: Generate summaries of lengthy clauses, automatically identifying legal risks, restrictions, or obligations (e.g., late payment penalties, warranty clauses) using Gemini.
- Intelligent Function Calling: Determine subsequent actions based on document content. When the amount exceeds a defined threshold, the tool automatically triggers a senior management approval process.
- RAG-Powered Interactive Retrieval: Store parsed structured data and vectorized text, and then allow users to ask questions in natural language. The tool directly locates relevant text and generates a summarized answer.
